## About Me
Hi there! My name is Mandy Koch and I'm in my first year as a graduate student in the LDT program. I don't have much coding or web design experience, but I'm **so** excited to get started with this class to learn more! I'm an educator at the [Museum of Life and Science](http://www.lifeandscience.org) in Durham, N.C. My focus at the museum is teaching through informal education and I hope to use my degree to incorporate new virtual technologies into the museum world. My undergraduate degree is in Paleobiology so I love all things paleontology, but _especially_ dinosaurs. My favorite pasttimes are bingeing Netflix, yoga, reading mystery novels, and **attempting** to learn how to bake. I look forward to meeting and working with you all this semester!
