# Mandy Koch

## About Me
Hi there! My name is Mandy Koch and I'm in my first year as a graduate student in the LDT program. I don't have much coding or web design experience, but I'm **so** excited to get started with this class to learn more! I currently live in Morrisville, N.C. I'm an educator at the [Museum of Life and Science](http://www.lifeandscience.org) in Durham, N.C. My focus at the museum is teaching through informal education and I hope to use my degree to incorporate new virtual technologies into the museum world. I went to UNC-Chapel Hill for undergrad and majored in Paleobiology. I love all things paleontology, but _especially_ dinosaurs. My favorite pasttimes are listening to podcasts while on long walks, reading mystery novels, and **attempting** to learn how to bake. Also, [I'm not superstitious, but I am a little stitious](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/)...(that's a quote from my favorite show...I also am a big fan of bingeing TV shows). I look forward to meeting and working with you all this semester!
